              <p>
                My journey in technology began early, when I chose Computer
                Science in my 11th and 12th grades. Thatâ€™s where I was first
                introduced to C++ programming, data structures, and web
                development with HTML and CSS.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and
                Engineering, I deepened my knowledge of programming with C++, C,
                Java, Python, and C#, applying data structures across these
                languages. I also explored JavaScript, PHP for backend
                development, and MySQL for database management, while continuing
                to build frontend skills with HTML.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my final year, I discovered my passion for data science and
                AI. For my capstone project, Storytelling Using Lifelogging, I
                built a system that generated textual stories from sequences of
                captioned images. I used VGG16 for feature extraction, LSTMs for
                text generation, and Tkinter for the GUI. This project sparked
                my long-term interest in machine learning and deep learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                After graduation, I joined Accenture as a Quality Assurance
                Engineer, where I worked for 15 months. I served as the point of
                contact for one application, handled both manual and automation
                testing, and used Selenium for test automation. I also built a
                Python script to automate permission setups and send reports
                once access was granted. My contributions earned me the
                Accenture Ace Award for achieving key project milestones.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even while working in QA, I knew I wanted to move toward a
                career in data science. This led me to pursue postgraduate
                studies at UNSW, where I worked on projects such as:{" "}
                <b>Gym Pose Estimation</b>, <b>Automatic Quiz Generator</b>{" "}
                (using the OpenAI API), and{" "}
                <b>Participation in the BerryJam Competition</b>, where we
                trained models with very limited image data. These experiences
                have shaped me into someone who can adapt quickly, balance
                multiple tasks, and continuously learn and deliver results.
